# Write Code That Is Easy to Delete, Not Easy to Extend

I found this article interesting because it highlights a very practical idea that feels like common sense, but is often ignored when writing code. The author explains that software usually changes by replacing or removing old features rather than endlessly extending them, so writing code that can be easily deleted is more valuable than writing code that is only easy to extend. While reading this, I realized that although this idea makes complete sense, I rarely think about it consciously when I code. I usually focus on adding new features instead of designing my code so that parts can be safely removed later. This article made me reflect on my own coding habits and showed me a simple principle that can greatly improve long-term code maintainability.

###I agree with this article in the sense that creating independent blocks of functionality that can be easily added and removed enhances the modularity of the code. It also relates to the concept of reusability: if we design code in self-contained modules, we can reuse them across different software projects. This reduces development time and encourages cleaner, more maintainable software architecture.
